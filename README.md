This code supports the publication [An integrated modelling framework from cells to organism based on a cohort of digital embryos](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep37438) , Villoutreix et al., Scientific Reports, 6:37438, 2016.


The compressed folder "prototype.zip" contains all the MATLAB files necessary to perform and visualize the complete statistical analysis of the cell lineages and to generate the prototype. It has been tested with Matlab R2011b and Matlab R2015a. A tutorial is provided in the file README.pdf contained in the folder.
